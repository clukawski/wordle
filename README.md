# `wordle`

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/clukawski/wordle.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/clukawski/wordle)

A simple Go wordle game engine library. Supports any language where each letter can be represented by a `utf-8` codepoint/`rune` type.

Wrote this as I wanted a wordle engine in Go that supported Polish language characters that could be integrated with another Go project.

See `examples/demo/main.go` for a usage example.
